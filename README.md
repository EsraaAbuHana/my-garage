Exam:
Create a new repository on your Github and name it 'my-garage'.

Build a one-page website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. The wire-frame of the targeted page is attached to Slack.

You will be building a simple webpage "My Car Garage" which contains all of the Cars that you have.

- As a user, I would like to be able to add new cars so I can track the cars I have in my garage. 
    - Create a form in order to add the **cars name** and **model category** and **model year**. 
    - The category should have a predefined list that contains the following categories: 
        - BMW
        - Lexus
        - Toyota
        - Tesla
        - Chevrolet
        - Hyundai
        - KIA

- As a user, I would like to view all of my cars that I already added so that I can quickly view my cars in my garage. - Whenever you add a car using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the cars from it and render them  using DOM.

- As a user, I would like to see along side the car information, the cars model image. The model images can be found in the folder directory img.

**Stretch Goals**
- As a user, I would like to delete any chosen car so I can handle the cars in my garage. - When you press on the 'X' button, the car should be deleted from the rendered DOM and the local storage.

- As I user, I would like to have the option to clear the whole rendered DOM. There will be a button when clicked it will clear the local Storage and the rendered DOM.
